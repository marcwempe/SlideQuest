Run replicate/bytedance-seedream-4.0 with an API

Headers

- Prefer string
	Leave the request open and wait for the model to finish generating output. Set to `wait=n` where n is a number of seconds between 1 and 60.
	See https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/create-a-prediction#sync-mode for more information.
- Cancel-After string
	The maximum time the prediction can run before it is automatically canceled. The lifetime is measured from when the prediction is created.
	The duration can be specified as string with an optional unit suffix:
	- `s` for seconds (e.g., `30s`, `90s`)
	- `m` for minutes (e.g., `5m`, `15m`)
	- `h` for hours (e.g., `1h`, `2h30m`)
	- defaults to seconds if no unit suffix is provided (e.g. `30` is the same as `30s`)
	You can combine units for more precision (e.g., `1h30m45s`).
	The minimum allowed duration is 5 seconds.

Request body

- input object Required
	The model's input as a JSON object. The input schema depends on what model you are running. To see the available inputs, click the "API" tab on the model you are running or [get the model version](https://replicate.com/bytedance/seedream-4/api/#models.versions.get) and look at its `openapi_schema` property. For example, [stability-ai/sdxl](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/sdxl) takes `prompt` as an input.
	Files should be passed as HTTP URLs or data URLs.
	Use an HTTP URL when:
	- you have a large file > 256kb
	- you want to be able to use the file multiple times
	- you want your prediction metadata to be associable with your input files
	Use a data URL when:
	- you have a small file <= 256kb
	- you don't want to upload and host the file somewhere
	- you don't need to use the file again (Replicate will not store it)
- webhook string
	An HTTPS URL for receiving a webhook when the prediction has new output. The webhook will be a POST request where the request body is the same as the response body of the [get prediction](https://replicate.com/bytedance/seedream-4/api/#predictions.get) operation. If there are network problems, we will retry the webhook a few times, so make sure it can be safely called more than once. Replicate will not follow redirects when sending webhook requests to your service, so be sure to specify a URL that will resolve without redirecting.
- webhook\_events\_filter array
	By default, we will send requests to your webhook URL whenever there are new outputs or the prediction has finished. You can change which events trigger webhook requests by specifying `webhook_events_filter` in the prediction request:
	- `start`: immediately on prediction start
	- `output`: each time a prediction generates an output (note that predictions can generate multiple outputs)
	- `logs`: each time log output is generated by a prediction
	- `completed`: when the prediction reaches a terminal state (succeeded/canceled/failed)
	For example, if you only wanted requests to be sent at the start and end of the prediction, you would provide:
	```json
	{
	  "version": "5c7d5dc6dd8bf75c1acaa8565735e7986bc5b66206b55cca93cb72c9bf15ccaa",
	  "input": {
	    "text": "Alice"
	  },
	  "webhook": "https://example.com/my-webhook",
	  "webhook_events_filter": ["start", "completed"]
	}
	```
	Requests for event types `output` and `logs` will be sent at most once every 500ms. If you request `start` and `completed` webhooks, then they'll always be sent regardless of throttling.

Examples

Create a prediction and get the output

Make a request

post /predictions

```python
import replicate

input = {
    "prompt": "a photo of a store front called \"Seedream 4\", it sells books, a poster in the window says \"Seedream 4 now on Replicate\"",
    "aspect_ratio": "4:3"
}

output = replicate.run(
    "bytedance/seedream-4",
    input=input
)

# To access the file URLs:
print(output[0].url())
#=> "https://replicate.delivery/.../output_0.jpg"

# To write the files to disk:
for index, item in enumerate(output):
    with open(f"output_{index}.jpg", "wb") as file:
        file.write(item.read())
#=> output_0.jpg written to disk
```

Input parameters

- prediction\_id string Required
	The ID of the prediction to get.

Examples

Get the latest version of a prediction by id

Make a request

get /predictions/{prediction\_id}

```python
import replicate

prediction = replicate.predictions.get(prediction_id)
print(prediction)
#=> Prediction(id="xyz...", status="successful", ... )
```

Input parameters

- prediction\_id string Required
	The ID of the prediction to cancel.

Examples

Cancel an in progress prediction

Make a request

post /predictions/{prediction\_id}/cancel

```python
import replicate

prediction = replicate.predictions.get(prediction_id)
prediction.cancel()
print(prediction)
#=> Prediction(id="xyz...", status="canceled", ... )
```

Examples

List the first page of your predictions

Make a request

get /predictions

```python
import replicate

predictions = replicate.predictions.list()
print(predictions.results)
#=> [Prediction(id="xyz...", status="successful", ... ), Prediction(id="abc...", status="successful", ... )]
```
