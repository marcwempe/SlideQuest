# SlideQuest Task Backlog

Use this file whenever the user assigns multi-step work that cannot be finished within a single prompt. Each top-level bullet should describe a high-level feature or refactor, followed by sub-bullets that can be delivered independently.

_Template_
- Feature / Refactor name
  - Subtask 1
  - Subtask 2
  - ...

Append new tasks at the top so the most recent priorities stay visible. Remove bullets once all subtasks are complete or explicitly dropped.
